# Snake-Water-Gun-game
Welcome to the Snake, Water, Gun game built using Python! This fun and interactive terminal game is a beginner-friendly version of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" — but with a twist. In this version, you and the computer face off using three options: Snake, Water, and Gun.  
Snake vs Water: Snake drinks the water → Snake wins

Water vs Gun: Gun sinks in the water → Water wins

Gun vs Snake: Gun shoots the snake → Gun wins

If both the user and the computer choose the same, it's a tie.
